1. Add in X-ray total scattering data.

2. The corner sharing octahedral is easier to be distorted. In our case, this
corresponds to the non-magnetic sublattice.

3. The edge sharing octahedral distortion is not that obvious, across the whole
doping range.

4. Combined with the discussion in Ref. [1], this seems to suggest that the
long-range crystal field, i.e., the interaction between the magnetic and
non-magnetic species that plays a critical role in determining the magnetic
properties.
